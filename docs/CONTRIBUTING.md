## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the
[aws-croniter Code of Conduct](https://github.com/siddarth-patil/aws-croniter/blob//CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior
to <hello@techwithsid.com>.

## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the
> available [Documentation](https://github.com/siddarth-patil/aws-croniter/blob/main/README.md).

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for
existing [Issues](https://github.com/siddarth-patil/aws-croniter/issues) that might help you. In case you have found a
suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search
the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/siddarth-patil/aws-croniter/issues/new).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide project and platform versions (python version, etc), depending on what seems relevant.

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

### Reporting Bugs

<!-- omit in toc -->

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to
investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the
following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using incompatible environment
  components/versions (Make sure that you have read
  the [documentation](https://github.com/siddarth-patil/aws-croniter/blob/main/README.md). If you are looking for
  support, you might want to check [this section](#i-have-a-question)).
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there
  is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in
  the [bug tracker](https://github.com/siddarth-patil/aws-croniter/issues?q=label%3Abug).
- Also make sure to search the internet (including Stack Overflow) to see if users outside the GitHub community have
  discussed the issue.
- Collect information about the bug:
    - Stack trace (Traceback)
    - OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)
    - Version of the interpreter, compiler, SDK, runtime environment, package manager, depending on what seems relevant.
    - Possibly your input and the output
    - Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions?

#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

> You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including sensitive information to the issue
> tracker, or elsewhere in public. Instead, sensitive bugs must be sent by email to <hello@techwithsid.com>.

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/siddarth-patil/aws-croniter/issues/new) using the template created for reporting
  [bugs](https://github.com/siddarth-patil/aws-croniter/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&projects=&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D+%3CExample+Title%3E). (
  Since we can't be sure at this point whether it is a bug or not, we ask you not to talk about a bug yet and not to
  label the issue.)
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the *reproduction steps* that someone else can follow to
  recreate the issue on their own. This usually includes your code. For good bug reports you should isolate the problem
  and create a reduced test case.
- Provide the information you collected in the previous section.

Once it's filed:

- The project team will label the issue accordingly.
- A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If there are no reproduction steps or no
  obvious way to reproduce the issue, the team will ask you for those steps and mark the issue as `needs-repro`. Bugs
  with the `needs-repro` tag will not be addressed until they are reproduced.
- If the team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be marked `needs-fix`, as well as possibly other tags (such as
  `critical`), and the issue will be left to be [implemented by someone](#your-first-code-contribution).

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for aws-croniter, **including completely new
features and minor improvements to existing functionality**. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the
community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

<!-- omit in toc -->

#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Read the [documentation](https://github.com/siddarth-patil/aws-croniter/blob/main/README.md) carefully and find out if
  the functionality is already covered, maybe by an individual configuration.
- Perform a [search](https://github.com/siddarth-patil/aws-croniter/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been
  suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to
  convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Keep in mind that we want features that will be
  useful to the majority of our users and not just a small subset. If you're just targeting a minority of users,
  consider writing an add-on/plugin library.

<!-- omit in toc -->

#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/siddarth-patil/aws-croniter/issues), and we
have created
a [template](https://github.com/siddarth-patil/aws-croniter/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&projects=&template=feature_request.md&title=%5BFEATURE%5D+%3CExample+Title%3E)
to be used for any new enhancement suggestions.

- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why. At this point
  you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you.
- You may want to **include screenshots or screen recordings** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the
  part which the suggestion is related to. You can use [LICEcap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on
  macOS and Windows, and the
  built-in [screen recorder in GNOME](https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-help/stable/screen-shot-record.html.en)
  or [SimpleScreenRecorder](https://github.com/MaartenBaert/ssr) on
  Linux. <!-- this should only be included if the project has a GUI -->
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most aws-croniter users. You may also want to point out the other
  projects that solved it better and which could serve as inspiration.

### Your First Code Contribution

Below is a guide to help you get started and ensure your contributions are smooth and impactful.

#### Setup Environment

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Begin by forking the repository to your GitHub account, then clone it locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/siddarth-patil/aws-croniter.git
   cd aws-croniter
   ```
2. **Set Up Poetry**
   Ensure you have [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) installed. Once installed, use it to set up
   the project dependencies:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```
3. **IDE Configuration**
   While you can use any IDE, **PyCharm** or **VS Code** are recommended for their robust Python support.

#### Code Contribution Workflow

1. **Create a New Branch**
   Before making changes, create a descriptive branch name that reflects your task. Examples:
    - bug-fixing-workflow-error
    - feature-adding-this-new-feature
    - doc-updating-readme
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-branch-name
   ```
2. **Make Changes**
   Implement your changes. Follow these guidelines:
    - Add **unit tests** where necessary. Ensure the project’s test coverage remains above **80%**.
    - Update **documentation** if your change affects usage or introduces new features.
3. **Run Linters and Tests**
    - Use [Ruff](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff) for linting:
      ```bash
      poetry run ruff .
      ```
    - Use [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to test compatibility across all supported Python versions:
      ```bash
      poetry run tox
      ```
   Ensure all tests pass before proceeding.
4. **Commit Your Changes**

   Write descriptive commit messages. A good format is:
   ```
   <type>: <short summary>

   <optional longer description>
   ```
   Example:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "fix: resolve issue with cron expression parsing on edge cases"
   ```
5. **Update Your Branch**

   Always ensure your branch is up to date with the main branch:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```
6. **Push and Open a Pull Request**

   Push your branch to your forked repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature-branch-name
   ```
   Open a **Pull Request** (PR) on the main repository. In your PR description, include:
    - What problem does this solve?
    - How was it solved?
    - Any testing considerations?

#### Final Checklist Before Submitting

- Tests pass for all environments: `poetry run tox`.
- Linting passes: `poetry run ruff .`.
- Test coverage is above 80%.
- Documentation is updated (if applicable)

### Improving The Documentation

Improving documentation is a vital way to contribute to **aws-croniter**. Here are some guidelines to help you update,
improve, or correct the documentation effectively:

#### When to Update Documentation

- **Adding a New Feature**: Include relevant details about how to use the new feature.
- **Fixing Bugs**: Update the documentation to reflect any changes in behavior or edge-case handling.
- **Clarifying Instructions**: If instructions are unclear or incomplete, feel free to enhance them.
- **Correcting Errors**: Fix typos, outdated information, or broken links.

#### How to Contribute to Documentation

1. **Locate the Relevant Section**  
   The documentation files are typically located in the `docs/` directory or directly within `README.md`.

2. **Make Your Edits**  
   Use clear and concise language. Add examples or visuals if they can improve understanding.

3. **Verify Your Changes**
    - Ensure any code snippets are functional and formatted correctly.
    - Preview your Markdown to confirm formatting is consistent.

4. **Submit Your Updates**  
   Follow the same contribution workflow as code contributions:
    - Create a branch (e.g., `doc-updating-readme`).
    - Commit your changes with a descriptive message.
    - Open a pull request, explaining what improvements you’ve made and why.

## Styleguides

### Commit Messages

Well-written commit messages help maintain a clear project history and make collaboration smoother. Follow this format
for your commit messages:

#### Format

```
 <type>: <short summary>

 <optional longer description>
 ```

#### Types

Use one of these types at the beginning of your commit message:

- **feat**: Adding a new feature (e.g., feat: support for cron interval parsing).
- **fix**: Fixing a bug (e.g., fix: handle edge case for invalid cron strings).
- **docs**: Updating documentation (e.g., docs: clarify setup instructions in README).
- **style**: Code style improvements (e.g., style: reformat with updated linter rules).
- **test**: Adding or updating tests (e.g., test: add cases for cron validation logic).
- **chore**: Routine tasks like dependency updates (e.g., chore: update Poetry to latest version).

#### Examples

- **Good Commit Message:**
  ```bash
  git commit -m "feat: add support for AWS-specific cron expressions" -m "Description: Adds support for parsing AWS-specific cron expressions, covering region-based nuances."
  ```
- **Bad Commit Message:**
  ```bash
  git commit -m "update code"
  ```

#### Additional Notes

- Use the imperative mood in your short summary (e.g., “Add feature” instead of “Added feature”).
- Keep the short summary under 50 characters when possible.
- Provide additional context in the longer description if necessary, especially for non-obvious changes.
